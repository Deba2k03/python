a=5
b=3
# 1.arithmstic operator
'''print("addition is:",a+b)
print("substraction is:",a-b)
print("multiplication is:",a*b)
print("division is:",a/b)
print("float division(only integer is occure):",a//b)
print("exponential :",a**b) #a to the power b
print("modulus :",a%b)
'''
#2. assignment operator
'''x=5  # = is a assignment operator
print(x)
x+=3  #x=x+3
print(x)
x-=2  #x=x-2
x*=3
x/=5
'''
#3. comparision operator
'''y=2
print(y==5)
print(y!=5)
print(y>4)
print(y<8)
print(y>=2)
print(y<=4)'''

# 4. logical oprator
'''p=True
q=False
print(p and q)
print(p or q)'''

#5. identity operator
# is
# is not
'''print(a is b)
print(a is not b)'''
a=6
b=7
if a is not b:

    print(a is b)
#6. membership operator
# in
# not in
'''list={1,2,3}
print(2 in list)
print(7 in list)
print(7 not in list)'''

#7. bitwise operator:work with bit(0,1)
# 2=010
